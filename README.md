# Personal website

This is a small personal website made after I realized I could buy a cool domain name. Pretty standard in terms of content.

The technologies used include [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). Definitely an overkill but hey, it was a small learning experience :)

## Development

I'm using version 3 of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) with [Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) activated.
After installing dependencies, running the website locally is done via

```bash
yarn dev
```

Deployment is done via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Each commit to the `main` branch triggers a deploy process.
